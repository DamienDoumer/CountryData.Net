### Install Library
```cSharp
   PM> Install-Package CountryData.Standard -Version 1.0.1
```


### Initialize the Country data object

```cSharp
       //loads all Country Data via the constructor (You can initialize this once as a singleton)
       var helper = new CountryHelper();
```


### Get list of Countries 
```cSharp
       var countries = helper.GetCountries();
       foreach (var country in countries)
       {
        Console.WriteLine(country);
       }
```


### Get list of Regions in a Country by Country Code
```cSharp
       var regions = helper.GetRegionByCountryCode("GH");
       foreach (var region in regions)
       {
        Console.WriteLine(region.Name);
       }
```

### Get the emoji flag of a Country by Country Code
```cSharp
       var flag = helper.GetCountryEmojiFlag("GH");
```


### Using lambda for custom querries
#### `GetCountryData()` returns an `IEnumerable<Country>` which can be querried with Lambda for a more flexible usage.
```cSharp
      //example1
      var data = helper.GetCountryData();
       //get list of countries by their Names
      var countries = data.Select(c => c.CountryName).ToList();
       foreach (var country in countries)
       {
        Console.WriteLine(country);
       }
       
       
       //example 2
       data.Where(x => x.CountryShortCode == "US")
                              .Select(r=>r.Regions).FirstOrDefault()
                              .ToList();
```


### Comming Soon
* Support for more ISO Standard Country Data
* Support for ISO 3166 Country A3 Codes
* Support for Country Phone Code
* Country ShortCode Enums
